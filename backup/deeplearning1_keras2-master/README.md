# Modified notebooks and Python files for Keras 2 and Python 3 from the fast.ai Deep Learning course
The repository includes modified copies of the original Jupyter notebooks and Python files from the excellent
(and really unique) deep learning course "Practical Deep Learning For Coders" part 1,
created by [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai). The [original files](https://github.com/fastai/courses)
require Keras 1 and Python 2.

The code in this repo has been tested on both Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.5 (installed through apt-get) and
macOS 10.12.4 with Python 3.6 (installed with Homebrew). A Python 3 virtualenv has been used in both cases.

In order to facilitate the installation of the required Python packages, this repository includes 
also two requirements files that can be used with the pip command.
Please note that the requirements files include also additional packages that, although not necessary,
might be useful for further exploration.
